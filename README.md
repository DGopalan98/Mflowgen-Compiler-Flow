# Mflowgen for Compiler Flow
This project contains an mflowgen design for the AHA compiler flow. The steps in this flowgraph are:
- setup
- hal_to_hw
- PE_gen
- metamapper
- clockwork
- constraints
- dc 


# Step Descriptions
## Setup 
Specify all the paths that will be accessed throughout the flow. The user edits the `setup/inputs/flow_setup.sh` file to specify the correct paths and set the `app_name`. The setup step copies this file into the build directory for other steps to access.  

## hal_to_hw

## PE_gen
